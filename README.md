# CGRA151_Final_Project_VUW
 Project files for the game I made as part of the final project for CGRA151 (Introduction to Computer Graphics)

All code and assets were entirely, independently created by myself.
This project was the final assessment of the course listed above at Victoria University of Wellington, and was
completed in October of 2019.
